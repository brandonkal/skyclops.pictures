description: Skyclops Pictures provided aerial droneography for this short student film. I worked as camera operator but most importantly as drone operator! This short student film is simply titled "Guy Meets Girl" and is directed by Andrew Carlisi. The charming film ends with a rising perspective and credits, which is an excellent example of how aerial cinematography can enhance narrative storytelling without distracting from the heart of the story.
