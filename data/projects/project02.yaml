description: Skyclops Pictures provided aerial droneography for this cute student short film. I worked as camera operator but most importantly as drone operator! This short student film is simply titled "Guy Meets Girl" directed by Andrew Carlisi. The short film ends with a rising perspective and credits, which is an excellent example of how aerial Cinematography can enhance narrative storytelling without distracting from the heart of the story.
